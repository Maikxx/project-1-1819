## Concept

The ability to explore content of the OBA is pretty poor, especially when looking at a certain location of the OBA in specific.

I choose to create a map with all the locations of the OBA on it, where you would select a location of your choice, or accept the one that is nearest to your current location.

1. When you select a location, you get to see a stacked view of floorplans, in order of floor level.
2. When you hover over a floor, a pop-up is shown with the contents of that floor on a section based level.
3. When you click on a floor, you get taken to a detail of that floor where you can explore the contents of that floor are shown on a section based level (for example, thriller books).
4. When you click on a section, you get taken to a page which shows you suggestions. On this page you can also search by text for related books of within this topic.
5. When you select a content item, you get taken to it's detail page with all the generic information about the book, while also showing you a map which shows on which locations of the OBA this content item is available at the time.
